    Co-authored the rigid body simulation pipeline built on top of existing \emph{bullet} and \emph{Physbam} rigid body libraries, developing the C++ backend and the python wrapped frontend. This system is used for all rigid body simulations in the Pixar inhouse animation system.

   In production, worked on the feature movie \emph{The Good Dinosaur} where I led the vegetation simulation effort in the context of character interaction. Also worked on the movie \emph{Inside Out} where I authored a new tool for animators to simulate secondary motion on top of hand-animated primary motion, saving them the time and effort of having to manually animate such effects.

    {\bf Software Engineer} \>Naiad Group at Exotic Matter \> Summer 2011\\
                          \>Stockholm, Sweden
   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
    Developed the Naiad Ocean Toolkit, a frequency spectrum based wave generator. The wave simulation generated by the toolkit can be merged with an existing Naiad FLIP water simulation, enabling visual effects studios to exclusively use Naiad for ocean sequences. I also wrote 3rd party Naiad plugins for Houdini and the Arnold renderer, allowing studios to use Naiad in their pipelines without any additional development work.
